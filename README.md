# Sign-in-the-Air-to-Unlock
This project explores a natural and secure authentication method for virtual and augmented reality by using in-air signatures drawn in 3D space. Instead of passwords or external devices, users authenticate by signing naturally with their hand while wearing a VR headset. The system captures x, y, and z motion trajectories and learns both the spatial shape and temporal dynamics of each signature using a deep neural network. By combining point-based motion details with global 3D structure, the approach enables user-specific, repeatable, and immersive authentication that maintains security without breaking user experience.
